#Keys and values are to be provided in a [<key> = "<value>"] format.
#   The spaces, = and the quotes are a must. The line is read and is stored into a config dict as <key>:<value> pairs where both the key and value are strings.
#   Keys may contain only upper/lower english alphabets. Any double quote inside the value must preceded by a \(backslash).
#   If a line starts with a non alphabetic character then that line is considered commented, but preferably use # to indicate comments
#   Very Important Note: The first line should always be a newline if you manually create a config file.

#Set file name structure
#   Possible identifiers are {Id}, {Name}. Example: *name = "{Id}-{Name}"* will name the file as its id followed by its name with a "-" in between
name = "" 

#Set Path for output folder, defaults to %cwd%\hentai if left blank. Example: *path = ".\hentai"* means a hentai folder 
#   where this file exists or you can just use the absolute path
path = "X:\DOUJIN-FILE\2" 

#Set Location of text file containing Ids/webpage URLs. Ids must be separated by any delimiter. URLs need nothing
#   It will read the largest consecutive group of numbers as 1 Id hence why Ids must be separated
batch = ".\\thread2-download.txt"

#Set how many pages are downloaded at once, defaults to 1 if empty. Strongly do not recommend going above 4 threads.
threads = "4"

#Sets the file type of the final output. Available types are pdf, cbz, cbt, cbz, img. Case-Sensitive. 
#   img will loosely save the files, i.e save the png files as-is in a folder named after the naming scheme.
#   Defaults to pdf for empty/any other value.
type = "pdf"

#Parameters below are manually created
